# Category Trends Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What was added

A new **"Category Trends"** tab has been added to the Categories page (`web/pages/4_Categories.py`) that provides temporal analysis of research categories, similar to the keyword trends functionality.

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### New Components Added:

1. **CategoryTrendsTab Class** (`CategoryTrendsTab`)
   - Manages the category trends over time visualization
   - Maps categories to grants through their keywords
   - Creates temporal trend plots (yearly or cumulative)

2. **Key Methods:**
   - `_map_categories_to_grants()`: Links categories to grants via keywords
   - `_create_yearly_data_for_category()`: Extracts temporal data from grants
   - `_create_category_trends_plot()`: Generates interactive Plotly visualization

### Data Flow:
```
Categories → Keywords → Grants → Temporal Analysis
    ↓           ↓         ↓           ↓
   Name    Associated  Grant IDs   Start Years
```

## 📊 Features

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - Slider to select number of categories (1-15)
  - Checkbox for cumulative vs yearly view
  - Generate button to create visualization

- **Visualization:**
  - Multi-line plot showing category trends over time
  - Hover information with category names and grant counts
  - Legend showing top categories by grant count
  - Responsive design with Plotly

- **Statistics:**
  - Categories displayed count
  - Categories with grants mapping
  - Total grant mappings
  - Most active category

## 🚀 Usage

1. Run the Categories page: `uv run streamlit run web/pages/4_Categories.py`
2. Navigate to the "📈 Category Trends" tab
3. Adjust settings using the controls
4. Click "Generate Category Trends" to create visualization

## 🔍 Technical Notes

- Categories are linked to grants through their constituent keywords
- Only categories with valid keyword-grant mappings are included
- Temporal data comes from grant `start_year` field
- Top categories are selected by total grant count
- Supports both yearly and cumulative trend visualization

## 📈 Example Output

The system successfully maps categories like:
- "Spintronics and Quantum Magnetism" (2010-2023 range)
- "Transcriptional Regulation in Development" (2000-2014 range)
- "Phosphorus Recovery and Recycling" (2004-2013 range)

Each showing temporal patterns of research activity over time.
