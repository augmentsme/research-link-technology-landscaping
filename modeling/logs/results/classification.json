This project aims to devise a novel Internet of Things (IoT) sensor sharing marketplace that permits IoT applications to discover, integrate, and pay for any IoT sensor data that is made available by other parties. The project will devise highly-scalable sensor classification, query processing, and transactions solutions and incorporate them in a pair of novel blockchains that work in tandem to securely manage all the information and contracts needed by IoT applications to discover, integrate, pay, and use sensors provided by another parties. These IoT advancements will provide significant economic, environmental, and social benefits via making low-cost and immediate sensing available across the world.\n",

The project aims to develop industrially scalable and environmentally friendly methods for synthesis of sequence-defined multiblock copolymers (polymer chains containing segments of different polymer types) using automated synthesis methods. The materials to be explored will be largely based on renewable biomass-derived monomeric building blocks. Such polymers are able to undergo microphase separation into spatially periodic compositional patterns, thereby providing access to a vast range of nano-engineered materials. This would enable design and synthesis of new advanced materials, making use of renewable resources and supporting the circular economy, with diverse potential applications ranging from nanomedicine to materials science.\n",

The proposed ARC Training Centre in Critical Resources aims to train the next generation of geoscientists needed to enable resourcing of the transition to a high-tech, clean energy society. Training of PhD students and postdoctoral scientists will primarily focus on bridging the gap between mineral systems science, mineral exploration protocols and ore processing/metallurgical extraction. This will provide geoscientists with an essential understanding of the whole value chain of the critical resources of the future.\n\n\n",

Emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide and methane are increasing from unknown sources.  High concentrations of these gases have been observed in coastal waters which bear the brunt of nutrient pollution (primarily nitrogen) from cities and agriculture.  This project aims to investigate the sources of these gases within these environments and the processes that lead to their formation.  This new knowledge is expected to develop new models which aim to enable us to better predict the emissions of greenhouse gases within coastal waters.  Expected benefit of this will be strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n",

This project aims to enhance the security of networks and information systems by empowering them with intelligent deception techniques to achieve proactive attack detection and defence. In recent times, the fictitious environment – honeypot designed by human experience becomes popular to attract attackers and capture their interactions. However, rules-based construction of honeypots fails in preserving the privacy, boosting the attractiveness and evolving the system. The project expects to advance deep learning and yield novel DeepHoney technologies with associated publications and open-source software. This should benefit science, society, and the economy by building the next generation of active cyber defence systems. \n",

This project is focused on understanding the interaction of cold atmospheric plasmas with biofilms, with the aim of biofilm eradication and ultimately offering an environmentally friendly alternative to current detergents and antibiotics. The research expects to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of action for breakthrough plasma intervention technologies, which are sufficiently active to cope with the resistant nature of biofilms, yet are of low energy, do not adversely affect surface properties and critically leave no residual chemistry. This should provide significant benefits by delivering a new method to tackle the ubiquitous problem of biofilm contamination in food, water and medical areas.\n",

Our research aims to answer fundamental geomorphic questions about the future of coral reefs, focusing on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). We will develop cutting-edge, fully open-source numerical models to quantify the eco-morphodynamic evolution of the GBR under IPCC climate-change scenarios. Our geomorphic numerical models will consider biotic/abiotic feedbacks including synergistic effects of multiple stressors such as waves, temperature, acidification and sediment transport, at individual reef scales. We will model the future of the GBR’s ecosystem-services, allowing for a quantum leap in the geomorphic knowledge and understanding of coral reef ecosystems. Expected outcomes include a gamechanger tool for future management of the GBR.\n",

The 2019/20 Australian fire season was unprecedented in its extent, impact, and the response of fire agencies. In this project, we aim to answer the question: was the scale of these fires driven by known drivers of fire (drought, weather, fuels and ignitions), or were fundamentally new undescribed processes and phenomena involved?  We will accomplish this by developing an innovative, physics-aware machine learning model of fire risk and spread, trained and validated on a two-decade satellite fire record.  The predictive ability of the model will be tested on the 2019/20 fire season to determine if novel drivers of fire can be identified, and the model itself will be operationalised into a novel short-to-mid term fire risk prediction tool.  \n",
