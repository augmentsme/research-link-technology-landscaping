# Research link: Technology Landscaping

## Project Description 
The ability to identify and understand internal and external collaboration networks presents an ongoing challenge for many research institutions. This is particularly true for analysing broader industry networks, communicating the impact of industry collaborative efforts, and enhancing the visibility of applied research outcomes. 

This project showcases how to leverage ARDC Research Link Australia (RLA) data to map research capabilities and partnerships. The RLA provides a foundational database to explore these collaborations by leveraging the persistent identifiers networks and linking ORCID to other PIDs like ROR, DOI, and RAID. This project enriches this data by infusing it with our internal Swinburne records and further enhances and connects it using an open-source generative AI. Specifically, GenAI enabled us to clean and connect otherwise siloed datasets, and provide visualisations of extensive collaboration networks.
