# AI-Powered Analysis of ORCID and RLA Data for Technology Landscaping 

## Abstract submitted to the conference

ORCID profiles provide a substantial amount of information about research communities. ORCID is considered a key data source for providing valuable and open-access data about researchers and their research works. However, ORCID also has potential to inform Technology Landscaping regarding researchers and their associated research networks, with potential applications including identifying technical expertise, emerging research communities, and investment opportunities. 

This presentation features a case study leveraging over 100,000 Australian ORCID researcher profiles and their research outcome collected from ARDC Research Link platform. We demonstrate how we have collected, connected, and analysed this dataset to observe the time-series evolution of the Australian research communities. The resulting animation will illustrate five years of historical developments within these communities. This will also establish a robust foundation for projecting future technological trends in Australia. 

Aligning with the technical aspect of this presentation, we demonstrate an AI pipeline using LLM model to analyse our data and achieve the visualisation results. This makes the solution presented in our work accessible and interoperable with many research infrastructure solutions in universities. We will discuss the technical challenges and opportunities observed while developing and deploying this solution in Nectar Cloud. We believe the lessons learned from our work can help identify potential new use cases for application of AI pipelines to analyse ORCID and other open scholarly data. 

## Project Description 

The ability to identify and understand internal and external collaboration networks presents an ongoing challenge for many research institutions. This is particularly true for analysing broader industry networks, communicating the impact of industry collaborative efforts, and enhancing the visibility of applied research outcomes. 

This project showcases how to leverage ARDC Research Link Australia (RLA) data to map research capabilities and partnerships. The RLA provides a foundational database to explore these collaborations by leveraging the persistent identifiers networks and linking ORCID to other PIDs like ROR, DOI, and RAID. This project enriches this data by infusing it with our internal Swinburne records and further enhances and connects it using an open-source generative AI. Specifically, GenAI enabled us to clean and connect otherwise siloed datasets, and provide visualisations of extensive collaboration networks.
