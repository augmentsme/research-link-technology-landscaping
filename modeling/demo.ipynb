The proposed research program investigates the role of microbiologically-induced corrosion (MIC) on stress corrosion cracking (SCC) of weldments of advanced stainless steels (SS). Extensive premature SCC failures of SS weldments have lately become increasingly significant in Australian marine industry, following the inability of advanced SCC-resistant SS to alleviate failures.  Inconsistencies in SCC data call for an improved understanding of the role of MIC on SCC, particularly because recent failure analyses have indicated a profound role of microbiological activity on localised corrosion (viz., pitting) of stainless steels and their weldments, as well as because pitting is known to facilitate SCC initiation.\\n',\n",

With the aging of Australia's population the impact of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's is rapidly on the rise. There is an urgent need to develop new and better drugs to treat the symptoms and underlying cause of these debilitating diseases. Historically, the majority of the world's pharmaceuticals have been drawn from biodiversity (ie plants, microbes and animals). As one of the few megabiodiverse nations, Australia is ideally positioned to accelerate and focus the search for drugs from nature. This project will explore an exceptionally promising pool of Australian biodiversity, its marine ecosystems, as a source of inspiration for the development of new drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases. \\n\",\n",

The project will provide a sound analysis of happiness, taking account of traditional welfare economics and recent advances in happiness studies, including making the analysis more relevant for policy formulation, making happiness measures more comparable interpersonally, intertemporally, and interculturally. A new and more appropriate national success indicator will be devised that takes positive account of some appropriate measure of happiness (adjusted happy life-years) and negative account of some measure of per capita external costs. This will encourage people, organizations, and governments to focus on factors that have a more direct bearing on people's happiness.\\n\",\n",

Australia’s rainfall is extremely variable, which means existing weather records are too short to calculate the true risk posed by droughts and floods. This project aims to quantify how naturally variable the rainfall coming from the Indo-Pacific mid-latitudes is, allowing recent rainfall extremes and future projections to be assessed in a long-term context. This project expects to produce new estimates of atmospheric moisture budgets between Australia and Antarctica based on a novel, 1000-year length reconstruction of moisture-bearing southern Indian Ocean storms. This new information is critically needed by water managers so that they can properly calculate (and ultimately prepare for) the worst of Australia’s rainfall-related risks.\\n\",\n",

This will be achieved by combining hospital and laboratory ethnography to examine how genomic data is produced, circulated and applied in clinical settings. The project aims to build a theoretical framework and conceptual understanding of genomic medicine that may be used by practitioners and may inform policy. This project should provide significant benefits such as minimising costs by helping identify and streamline decision-making processes, and by showing how public engagement practices shape patients' and practitioners' approaches to genomics.\\n\",\n",

This project aims to quantify variation in leaf water isotopes and develop mechanistic models for paleoclimatologists and plant scientists to constrain global carbon cycles. Leaf water stable isotopes influence the isotope compositions of atmospheric oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapour, and impart an evaporative signal on the isotope composition of plant organic material. These isotope signals have been used to constrain global carbon and water cycles and reconstruct past climates. This project aims to quantify variation in leaf water isotopes and develop mechanistic models for use by paleoclimatologists, plant scientists and to constrain global carbon cycles and develop accurate models of leaf water isotopes to reduce uncertainty in climate models.\\n',\n",
